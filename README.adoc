= vamp-ansible
For Vamp (http://vamp.io/) a multimachine ansible script.

== Topology
I am lucky to have a vmware datacentre with rhel7 virtual machines available to me.
And I wanted to share my personal ansible script with you to install:

. zookeeper
. mesos
. marathon
. docker
. *vamp*

This ansible playbook installs on each host a docker daemon.
Also on each host a mesos install
On one host the marathon schedular
And on the other four hosts a mesos slave.
For Vamp I use one machine directly the docker daemon to install vamp-router.
And on the marathon host I install directly onto docker the 'Vamp' v0.7.5. 


It is tailored to the datacentre I am using. So please look at all the files
and adjust it to your needs. It is almost the same as I use but I had to
change the inventory file with different IP's.

Have fun with it and let me know what you think of it.
